Assignment 1: Matrix Library

Due date: 27/11/2018 

Implement a templated library handling matrices, vectors, and covectors; where vectors are nx1 matrices and covectors are 1xn matrices.

the library must offer operation like:

* submatrix: return a matrix that contains a contiguous subrange of rows and columns of the original matrix
* transpose: return a matrix with rows and columns inverted
* diagonal: return a vector containing the diagonal elements of a given matrix
* diagonalmatrix: return an unmodifiable diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are those of a given vector

The matrices returned by such operators must share the data with the original matrix, but direct copy of the matrices and vectors must result in a deep copy (sharing a matrix can be obtained by taking a submatrix extending the whole row and column ranges).

Create forward iterators for the matrix traversing it either in row-major or column-major order. Any matrix should be traversable in either direction regardless of its natural representation order. Any given iterator will traverse only in a given order.

##ASSUMPTIONS

* vectors are nx1 matrix
* covectors are 1xn matrix

##USAGE

Initialize a new matrix:

``` c++
std::vector < int > elements_vector_a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
matrix < int > int_matrix (elements_vector_a, 2, 3);

std::vector < double > elements_vector_b = {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6};
matrix < double > double_matrix(elements_vector_b, 3, 2);

std::vector < char > elements_vector_c = {'a', 'b', 'd', 'g', 'e', 'g', '', '4', ']'};
matrix < char > char_matrix(elements_vector_c, 3, 3);

matrix < int > error (elements_vector_a, 0, 3); // error: invalid input row
matrix < int > error (elements_vector_a, 2, -1); // error: invalid input column
matrix < int > error (elements_vector_a, 3, 3); // error: invalid input vector

double_matrix.getRowNumber() == 3; // true
double_matrix.getColumnNumber() == 2; // true
```

Access elements of a matrix:

``` c++
double a_double = double_matrix(accessed_row,accessed_column);
```

Assign values to elements:

``` c++
int value;
m(row,column);
```

Copy a matrix:
```
matrix<int> copied_matrix = int_matrix;
matrix<double> double_matrix.transpose();
auto int_matrix.diagonal();
const auto int_matrix.diagonal_matrix(); // note the use of const to avoid accessing a const reference
```

Transpose a matrix:
``` c++
double_matrix.transpose();
double a_double = double_matrix.transpose()(row, column);
a_double == 0.4; // true
```

Obtain a vector of diagonal elements of a matrix:
``` c++
int_matrix.diagonal();

```

Obtain a const diagonal matrix:
``` c++
int row = 1, column = 2;
const auto constant_diagonal_matrix int_matrix.diagonal_matrix(); //note the use of const

constant_diagonal_matrix(row,column) = 666; // error: unmodifyable matrix
int an_int = constant_diagonal_matrix(row,column);
an_int == 0; // true
constant_diagonal_matrix(2,2) == 5; // true
```

Obtain a submatrix:
``` c++
pair <int, int> first_element_position = (2, 2);
pair <int, int> last_element_position = (3, 3);
auto sub_matrix = char_matrix.submatrix( first_element_position, last_element_position);

double a_double = double_matrix.submatrix( pair<int,int>(1,1), pair<int,int>(2,1));
```

The client code have to manage two different classes: matrix and shared_matrix, the only difference is that the formers's copy construct does a deep copy of the data while the latter's copy constructor return a matrix that share data with the original one.

Our matrix template offer the following operations:

``` c++

    E operator ()( int accessed_row, int accessed_column) const;

    E& operator ()(int accessed_row, int accessed_column);

    E getRowNumber() const;

    E getColumnNumber() const;

    shared_matrix <E> transpose() const;

    shared_matrix <E> diagonal() const;

    shared_matrix <E> submatrix(pair <int, int > first_pair, pair <int ,int > second_pair) const;

    const shared_matrix <E> diagonal_matrix() const;

    row_matrix_iterator <E> begin() const;

    row_matrix_iterator <E> end() const;
    
```

##DESIGN

###Decorator design pattern

Our matrix template has been designed with the decorator pattern. In particular we have implemented this pattern using the dynamic polymorphism offered by c++ :

* matrix_impl: is the interface for the base matrix class and the decorator classes. 

* base_matrix_impl: has two integers r and c that represent row and column numbers, and a vector data, of type E, which contains the elemnts of the matrix. 

* transposed_matrix_impl:
        the decoration class for the transposed matrix which has a pointer to the decorated matrix;
        it overrides the accessors calling the same methods to the wrapped matrix with inverted input. 

* diagonal_impl:
        the decoration class for the transposed matrix which has a shared pointer to the decorated matrix;
        it is a vector (a matrix with r rows and 1 column) accessing elements of the decorated matrix which are on diagonal positions; note that its rows are the minimum between rows and columns of the decorated matrix.
    
* diagonal_matrix_impl:
        the diagonal matrix is an unmodifyable matrix which returns ```0```s on non-diagonal positions;
        it must be used with the keyword ```const``` upon copy even if the keyword ```auto``` is used; otherwise the user risks to cause an "Unmodifyable matrix" error.

* submatrix_matrix_impl:
        a decoration of the matrix class, which has a shared pointer to the decorated matrix;
        it is a vector which accesses a portion of elements of the decorated matrix.
        its creator takes two pairs of ```<int>```s which refer to the positions of the first and last elements of the matrix;
        its default creator returns a decoration of the matrix with all the elements; it gives therefore no error, but it is not advisable to do so as it lengthen the chain of decorations;

###Shared pointers
In our design we decided to use smart ponters over raw pointers to manage lifetime of the objects, thus preventing memory leaks from unexpected behaviours from user's program.**FIL**Ã¨ ok? 

Once we decided to use smart pointers we discussed the advantages / disadvantages between two possibile implemetations

###PIMPL idiom
The PIMPL Idiom (Pointer to IMPLementation) is a technique for implementation hiding in which a public class wraps a structure or class that cannot be seen outside the library the public class is part of.

We adopted PIMPL to 

The file matrix.h contains the classes matrix and matrix_temp.
The matrix_temp class has been created to avoid making a deep copy invoking the copy constructor:
It does things in this way so that other thing is accomplished. <-inglese per "fa cose" **FIL**

###Iterators

The file iterator.h contains things. They do things in this way so that other things are done. **FIL**

Errors are const char *, thrown to inform the user. **FIL**
